# Creating a credit card fraud detection model using Snap ML (Machine Learning) is a valuable data science project. Snap ML is a machine learning library that's optimized for large-scale, high-performance data processing. Here's a project description outlining the key steps and components:

# Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Snap ML

# Project Overview:
# Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and consumers. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Snap ML to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data efficiently. Snap ML, being a highly optimized library, will enable real-time or near real-time processing, making it ideal for fraud detection.
